             <h2>About me</h2>
             <p>Hello there! I'm Rouhin Mukherjee, an enthusiastic and motivated Computer Science Engineer with a passion for data science and data analysis. I believe in the power of data to drive meaningful insights and make informed decisions, which is why I chose to specialize in this field.

                Education and Background:
                I am pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering, where I gained a strong foundation in programming, algorithms, and database management. During my academic journey, I developed a keen interest in the world of data and its potential to transform various industries.
                
                Expertise in Data Science and Data Analysis:
                Over the past five months, I have been honing my skills in data science and data analysis. My expertise lies in handling large datasets, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning algorithms. I enjoy using tools such as Python, power.BI , and SQL to extract valuable insights from raw data, helping organizations make data-driven decisions and solve complex problems.
                
                Professional Experience:
                I've had the opportunity to apply my knowledge in the real world during my five-month professional experience. Working as a data scientist, I collaborated with cross-functional teams to develop predictive models, optimize business processes, and identify opportunities for improvement. It has been a challenging yet rewarding experience, and I'm eager to continue expanding my horizons in this dynamic field.
                
                Venturing into Web Development:
                In addition to my data science journey, I recently delved into web development. I find it fascinating how web technologies empower us to create interactive and user-friendly applications that can reach a global audience. My early experiences in web development have been promising, and I'm continuously learning new frameworks and tools to enhance my skills.
                
                Passion and Drive:
                My passion for technology, combined with my curiosity to explore new areas, drives me to stay updated with the latest trends and advancements in the field of computer science. I am always open to new challenges and opportunities that allow me to grow both personally and professionally.
                
                Future Aspirations:
                Looking ahead, I aspire to make a significant impact in the field of data science and data analysis. I aim to work on projects that contribute to society, address real-world problems, and bring about positive change. Additionally, I hope to utilize my growing expertise in web development to create innovative web applications that provide meaningful solutions to users.
